# Project 3: Modeling Neurodiverse Experiences

---

## Overview

The series of notebooks, data files, data visual images, and slideshow presentation contained herein include a review of the ADHD and autism subreddits with specific organizational recommendations geared to a disability advocacy organization looking to support new clients seeking peer social support and services in either ADHD or autism communities. The task of creating an API webscraping script, collecting data, and modeling with text data in these notebook files was generated by General Assembly (GA), but the choice of subreddits, problem statement, data collection methods, data analysis and visualization, classification models and iterations, and ultimate organizational recommendations represent the expertise and opinions of the author. The following README file contains an executive summary of the problem statement, data dictionaries for the final production model dataset, summary of final production model, and recommendations presented before the disability advocacy organization.

## Problem Statement

The models contained here in these subsequent notebooks were developed for a disability right advocacy organization which aims to provide peer social support and services. The problem that we are trying to solve is:

Many people experience the symptoms and signs of neurodiversity but often struggle to identify how their lived experience compares to a specific neurodiverse condition. For novice clients seeking social support for their neurodiversity, how can we use the written experiences of others living with ADHD and autism to build a model which most accurately classifies a novice's written, personal testimony as being one of more likely living with ADHD or autism?

Since we will be using approximately 50% ADHD and 50% autism social media posts from Reddit's website, we will aim to build a model which will improve on the baseline accuracy score by approximately 40 percentage points or roughly 90% accuracy.

## Data Collection, Dataset, and Data Dictionary

The author developed an API webscraper to collect data from two different subreddits forums on Reddit's social media platform. The authoer chose the ADHD and autism subreddits from which to collect text posts data for analysis. The final dataset includes over 4,800 unique text posts, approximately half from each of the two focal subreddits. Data was collected and logged approximately every 24 hours for a week and analyzed in multiple iterations before preprocessing and the model iteration to arrive at a final production model. The reader may look at the final dataframe's data dictionary below:

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|title|object|Subreddit Posts|Title of the subreddit post|
|selftext|object|Subreddit Posts|Text of the subreddit post|
|subreddit|integer|Subreddit Posts|Subreddit to which the post belongs. 0: ADHD, 1: autism|
|post_word_count|integer|Subreddit Posts|Word count for a given post|
|post_length|integer|Subreddit Posts|Character length for a given post|
|selftext_lemma|object|Subreddit Posts|Lemmatized post text|
|sentiment|float|Subreddit Posts|Composite score of a post's sentiment analysis|

## Summary of Analysis

In analyzing the data, the following methodology was taken:

1. After collecting and cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis was used to explore distinct differences in the two subreddits for the purposes of identifying stop words which either a novice may not use to describe their lived experience with neurodiversity or which may be too unqiue or technical for one of the two communities.

2. A logistic regression model was fit over the same grid search with four different sets of features to see which features performed best in this preliminary model based on test accuracy score. Our feature selection revealed that lemmatized text posts performed best and became our selected features for subsequent model iterations.

3. The selected features were used to iterate over five subsequent classification models, include three ensemble methods. All of these model's test accuracy scores were compared with the logistic regresssion preliminary model.

4. The final production model was evaluated also on the basis of sensitivity and precision to determine any drawbacks in the model and make final organizational recommendations.

## Organizational Recommendations

Our production model did fall short of our target accuracy of 90%, making accurate predictions approximately 82% of the time. Based on these other other metrics, we recommend the followingL

* If accuracy is important to the organization, invest in collecting more data from different sources to improve model.
* Use the model as a preliminary referral tool but invest in an added layer of an expert professional to identify any potential model errors.
* Begin offering a mixed neurodiversity support group for new clients to explore identity before referring to specific affinity groups.
